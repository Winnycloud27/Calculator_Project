# CALCULATOR_PROJECT

In this folder I created a simple calculator that does addition, substraction, multiplication, division and modulos of a number.

_*This project is divided into three parts/file:*_

* The header file 'header.h'
* The 'operator-function.c' file is where I did all the calculation both addition, substraction, multiplication, division and modulos
* Lastly, the 'simple-calculator.c' which is our main file i.e the entry point of my code.

_*This is a psuedocode for the project*_

* Prompt the user to enter the operation to perform with their respective sign
* Read user input and store in the operator variable
* Logic goes here
* Set your function pointer trigger to user-input using ifelse statement
* and checking condition of each, if condition is true assign the function.
* of that operator to your function.
* When the user put the operator to calculate for
* Prompt, enter the first operand
* Read in user-input
* Prompt, enter the second operand
* Read in user-input
* Declare an int variable and assign the function pointer
* int result = s(the two operand the user inputed), s(a, b);
* print out the result to the user.
